The python scripts will load and/or save the neural network model to the 'storage/model/current' folder.

# Saving a model
If at any point you want to make a backup or you want to train multiple models and compare them later, you can do that by saving the model. To save the current model, just make a copy of the 'current' folder, and give it a different name.

# Using a saved model
If you want to use a model you've previously saved using the method above, just replace the 'current' folder with the folder that contains the model you want to use. Make sure the folder is again named 'current', or the scripts won't be able to find it.
